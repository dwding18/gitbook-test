# K-Atlas

## What It Does

**K-Atlas** \(_pronounced **Cutlass**_\), is a distributed graph based platform to automatically collect, discover, explore and relate multi-cluster Kubernetes resources and metadata. The system will have a rich query language that will allow for simple and efficient exploration and extensibility.

It addresses following problems in an enterprise environment of Kubernetes.

* **Discoverability**
  * Find K8s objects across multiple distributed K8s clusters
  * Real-time view discovered objects
  * Streaming APIs and UI for programmatic and human interactions
* **Advanced Exploration**
  * Identify similarities and differences between objects from pods to clusters
  * In depth analysis of individual characteristics like performance
* **Federated Application View**
  * Take an application centric view - correlate an applicationâ€™s metadata across multiple clusters
* **Reporting**
  * Provide advanced reporting on compliance, security and other organizational policies
* **Policy Enforcement**
  * Allow for organizational policies to be enforced across the fleet in a consistent manner

Check out more details on [Motivation and Use Cases](docs/motivation.md) K-Atlas is addressing.

It provides a Web Viewer that can be used to search the Kubernetes cluster data and view graphical results in real time. Click [here to see a demo](https://www.useloom.com/share/eb97aa1054004be197e3ed732223e689).
